<!--
Starting with Python, continued: getting input from users,
conversion functions, arithmetic operations, string operations

(slides available in the class_share folder on JupyterHub)

__Additional readings__:

- [Module \#2](https://cs.nyu.edu/elearning/CSCI_UA_0002/module02.php) - the modules use a different
environment for writing Python (Idle, instead of Jupyter notebooks - but you can ignore the bits about the environment)
- [Basics from _A Byte of Python_](https://python.swaroopch.com/basics.html) - there are
some topics here that we did not cover, but they might come in handy later or if you want to experiment
- [Operations and Expressions _A Byte of Python_](https://python.swaroopch.com/op_exp.html) - there
are some topics here that we did not cover, but they might come in handy later or if you want to experiment
