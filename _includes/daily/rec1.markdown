Lab 1 available on JupyterHub.

Final version due on Wednesday, Sept. 11 at 11:59pm. 
(You do not need to submit your file anywhere. You should have the final version
	in your folder on JupyterHub for the grader to download it.)

__If you register for the class late__, and cannot access the JupyterHub website
(try to log in with your NYU netID and password - same as you use for your NYU email),
then you can request an account by completing this [form](https://iiq.home.nyu.edu/identityiq).
Specify jk157 (Prof. Joanna Klukowska) as your sponsor.
