# Academic Email Etiquette
---

* Check the school email address on a regular basis. You can simply forward its content
to another email account that you use regularly.

* Use your __school's email account__ to send emails to professors, instructors, TA's, graders,
administrators, etc. It is a violation of federal law, [FERPA - the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act](http://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/forms-policies-procedures/FERPA.html)
to have an email conversation about school-related matters using a non-
school account because there is no proof that it is not spoofed and
might be insecure. (Email sent from your school's account requires an authenticated login,
it satisfies FERPA's written consent requirement. However because
security measures for other email systems are not as strict or verifiable, an email
received another mail accounts would NOT satisfy FERPA requirements.)


* Start your email with proper salutations! Use the correct titles (Professor, Dr., Dean, etc.)
and spell first and last names correctly. If you are on the first name basis with your instructors,
use their names, not "Hey". For example: "Dear Professor Drummer" or "Dear Robert", not "Hey Bob".

* Sign your name under the body of your email, otherwise you expect people to read emails from anonymous.

* Do not write everything in upper-case letters. Do not write everything in lower-case letters.

* Make sure you included everything you wanted before hitting send. Don't send three emails
one after another because you forgot something in the first one.

* Proofread the text in your email before sending it. Most of the email clients check for
typos, but they cannot tell if your email makes much sense. Read it, before you send it.
